# 2: Models of Financial Markets on Finite Probability Spaces
## 2.1 Description of the Model

In this section we shall develop the theory of pricing and hedging of derivative securities in financial
markets.

In order to reduce the technical difficulties of the theory of option pricing to a minimum, we assume 
throughout this chapter that the probability space $\Omega$ underlying our model will be finite, say,
$\Omega=\{\omega_1,\omega_2,...,\omega_N\}$ equipped with a probability measure $\textbf{P}$ such that 
$\textbf{P}[\omega_w]=p_n>0$, for $n=1,...,N$. This assumption implies that all functional-analytical
delicacies pertaining to different topologies on $L^\infty(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\textbf{P})$,
$L^1(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\textbf{P})$,$L^0(\Omega,\mathucal{F},\textbf{P})$ etc. evaporate, as all these 
spaces are simply $\mathbb{R}^N$ (we assume that the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ in later chapters
for the case of more general processes, reduces in the setting of the present chapter to simple linear 
algebra. For example, the use of the Hahn-Banach theorem replaced by the use of the separating hyperplane
theorem in finite dimensional spaces.
