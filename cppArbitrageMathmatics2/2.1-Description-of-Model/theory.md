## 2 - Models of Financial Markets on Finite Probability Spaces
### 2.1 Description of the model

In this section we shall develop the theory of pricing and hedging of derivative securities in
financial markets.

In order to reduce the technical difficulties of the theory of option pricing to a minimum, we
assume throughout this chapter that the probability space $\Omega$ underlying our model will be
finite, say, $\Omega = \{ \omega_1,omega_2,...,\omega_N\}$ equipped with a probability
measure $\textbf{P}$
